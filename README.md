### Apr 6
Model group meeting:
1. Shared paper 1 and 2
2. Learn to use D-EYE lens. Recorded retina video for undiluted eyes.
3. Need higher quality pictures for testing. Ways to concatenate pictures for different areas into one (or no need to do that?)

### Apr 4
preprocessing:
whitening
anomaly detection


### Apr 3

### Nov 7
Meeting with Dr. Hayashi.
1. Data: 
	Weâ€™ll first work on library photos. Then try to generalize the program to classify iPhone photos. Data is preferably stored in Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Amazon cloud can be a backup choice. After we decide the place to store, we will create an interface for uploading the data (also sharing the data among contributors).
2. Program:
	We can try to build other image classification program using other datasets, so that when our retina data is ready, we just need to make some adjustment.
